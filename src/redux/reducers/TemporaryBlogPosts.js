                As we transition into adulthood a lot of us drop this virtue of seeking wisdom. <br/> <br/>
                As children and adolescents we are constantly asking questions, seeking wisdom, asking why things are the way they are, open to ideas and possibilities.
                Then we are put into a system designed to teach us how to get a job, make money, spend that money on things we don’t need...then die. Hopefully having some laughs along the way. <br/> <br/>

                The most fulfilled people I have been blessed to know on this journey are those who are constantly seeking wisdom. A pursuit that has no end and no win or loss. A never ending path closer to our self.
                On this journey one will attain wisdom on who they are and what it is they are here to pursue. Clarity on why they are here and who to serve.
                <br/> <br/>
                I feel asking questions about ourselves, and about the world around us is the key to unlock this gift of a fulfilled life. One of connection, love, clarity, joy and ease.
                Do you have a daily practice and intention aligned to the pursuit of wisdom?

                Breaking the norm, stepping away from the familiar, in search of new experiences, meeting new people, getting lost in adventure and curiosity…

                How often in today’s culture do we intentionally create adventure for ourselves?

                The norm is to work 49-50 weeks of the year and find some time in between to relax...and take it easy and maybe get away for a week or two. Usually to somewhere familiar.
                <br/><br/>Repeat until retirement, then the adventure begins… what huh?

                What! F%#! that…well that’s where I stand.

                What if every day could be an adventure, a morning walk, an evening hike, a beach or park for lunch to people watch, visit an art exhibit or museum,
                take a new way to work, explore parts of your city that you’ve never been in, re-explore parts of your city you know from a new lens of adventure.
                <br/><br/>
                Creating new experiences feeds all parts of us. Our mind fills with curiosity and wonder. Our body moving,
                breathing, taking on something new and our soul absorbing gratitude, pleasure and fulfillment.

                It is not always the place or people, it is the intention that today will be an adventure. <br/><br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where will you adventure today?</li>
                    <li>How does it feel just thinking about and planning an adventure?</li>

                Anything we do can become a ceremony. Take time before you cook a meal, go for a walk, sit in nature, clean your home, breath, have a bath, meditate, play music, write, massage your partner... Set an intention, express them and give gratitude. <br/> <br/>

                This creates the container of ceremony, instead of just going through the motions. If we can bring each of these beautiful moments in our lives into a ceremony the power of the intention we set will unlock a level of joy, clarity, ease and fulfilment in all we do.
                Get creative, add music, burn sage, use oils, light candles. Yes even doing the dishes can be enjoyable. Slow down and create it.
                What will you now make a ceremony in your  life?

                I get that we are being confronted a lot these days. Confronted with not knowing what's to come, who to trust, what to believe.
                What I have come to understand is that the key to facing confrontation is to face it head on.
                <br/><br/>
                To be in the discovery of ourselves and being in communication, authentic conversations with the people that are the source of the confronting emotions.
                A lot of the time that person is ourselves. We get so wrapped up in the story we have created that we become stopped, we hide, we disconnect. Unable to express, to think to take action.
                <br/><br/>
                It is not an easy thing to do, taking responsibility for creating all that is around us. Knowing we are the source of it all and that only we can recreate what's to come.
